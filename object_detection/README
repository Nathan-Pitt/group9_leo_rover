================= How to Launch and Operate Camera Object Detection =================

=== Launching Realsense Camera ===

If you haven't launched the realsense camera on your device before, you might need to download the SDK and ros packages.
If you have already downloaded the SDK and packages, skip to step 3.

Step 1: Install latest Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0

	sudo apt install ros-humble-librealsense2*

Step 2: Install debian package from ROS servers

	sudo apt install ros-humble-realsense2-*

Step 3: Run Realsense Camera Node

	ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py depth_module.profile:=848x480x30 rgb_camera.profile:=848x480x30 align_depth.enable:=true

This should launch the node and have the depth to colour frames aligned. Next is running the object detection

=== Launching Object Detection ===

You might need to install some packages, the one that I know of is:

	pip install pyrealsense2

If there are any more and/or the file doesn't run, please let me know.
Download the object detection package in this github.

Step 1: Open a terminal then transition to the base of the package, making sure to colcon build and source.

	cd ./object_detection
	colcon build
	source install/setup.bash

Step 2: Run the python script

	ros2 run ros2_opencv camera_sensor_subscriber

This should open a window in a couple seconds showing you what is being detected / the pose of the object.
